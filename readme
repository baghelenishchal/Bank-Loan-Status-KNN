Given the normalized data set of bank loan with 8 features and 1 target feature  both in separate csv files.

Training Data File Format: 
P4.csv file contains input attributes (x1, x2, â€¦ , x8) in 8 columns. 
The P4y.csv file contains one column representing the Boolean class label (y).
Each row is a training instance. 

Input Sample:

Read the csv file from this directory: "/data/training/P4.csv"
P4.csv:
[[ 0.516  0.921  2.33  ... -0.382  1.14  -0.87 ]
 [ 0.516  0.921  0.342 ...  2.62  -0.88  -0.87 ]
 [ 0.516 -0.959 -0.653 ... -0.382 -0.88   1.15 ]]


Read the csv file from this directory: "/data/training/P4y.csv"
P4y.csv:
[1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]


Your job is to: 
Split the data-set into train and test sets using sklearn with test_size=0.2 
Find out the best value of K with maximum mean accuracy using iterations for K nearest neighbor 
Save the  maximum accuracy along with best K value in a csv file

Output Sample:

Save the output file in following directory:   "/code/P4_eval.csv"

 [ 0.867 5 ]

Note: 
The sample output may not be the real output.
You can use numpy genfromtext to read csv file since it doesn't contain headers
